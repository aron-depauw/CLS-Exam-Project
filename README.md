# CLS-Exam-Project
This public GitHub repository is meant for sharing files related to the CLS Exam Project.

## Repository overview
This CLS-Exam-Project repo contains all relevant files related to the CLS Exam Project (including early bird submissions). It contains all necessary data and code as well as any accompanying documentation (progress reports, papers, etc.) Currently, the folder only contains materials for the second early bird deadline (Monday 13 June 2022, midnight) in .zip format due to file size limitations. To access these materials, please navigate to the CLS_Exam_Project_Pessoa_early_bird_2.zip file and click download to save the folder and unzip it. Finally, please note that the work in this folder is very much incomplete and still a work in progress and was uploaded here to make use of the feedback possibility.
